# Tips

## Increasing Reps

To increase reps you treat the workouts as practice.
You **try** to increase 1-2 reps every workout. You try to get it to failure every 2-3 workout sessions.

This makes sure you put in enough for the muscle fibers to get stronger.

If you can do 1 set of 10 reps for an exercise add in a new set and try to achieve the `Intermediate` reps.

Once there, repeat the steps to reach the Progression level.
