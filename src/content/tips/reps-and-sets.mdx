### How to use

The calculator is based on basic strength training and dropsets. Each set has an
original target and generates a subset based on the remaining reps required.

The principle of slow strength training still apply and you should rest between
each set or subsets(if any) for around 2-3 minutes minimum.

You can progress to the next variation of the exercise once you can do this
setup without any sub sets
